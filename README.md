# Graph2Layout
A novel deep learning model is provided in this project to aid designers in creating the spatial arrangement of residential plans.
The building design process may be considerably accelerated by automating space allocation. This research aims to provide a platform
that allows architects to construct spatial layouts using deep learning algorithms while preserving high degrees of control over the outcomes.
The findings demonstrate that the suggested method can develop spatial arrangement solutions using fixed boundaries and established topological requirements.
